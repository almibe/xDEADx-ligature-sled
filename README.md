# ligature-sled
An implementation of Ligature that uses Sled for storage.

## Status
This project isn't used anymore.
See https://github.com/almibe/ligature or
https://github.com/almibe/ligature-jvm for updated projects.

## How Storage is Handled
The default tree stores only the names of all the datasets stored.
Each dataset then has its own tree where the records for a given dataset are stored.

ligature-sled uses a set of `u8` prefixes before any entry into the database.
Below is a list of what is currently being used.

| Prefix | Description            | Stored In    | Key         | Value    |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| 0      | Dataset Name           | Root tree    | `u8 string` | _        |
| 1      | Entity Counter         | Dataset tree | `u8`        | `u64`    |
| 2      | Attribute Counter      | Dataset tree | `u8`        | `u64`    |
| 3      | Attribute Name to ID   | Dataset tree | `u8 string` | `u64`    |
| 4      | Attribute ID to Name   | Dataset tree | `u8 u64`    | `string` |
| 5      | EAVC                   | Dataset tree | see note    | _        |
| 6      | EVAC                   | Dataset tree | see note    | _        |
| 7      | AEVC                   | Dataset tree | see note    | _        |
| 8      | AVEC                   | Dataset tree | see note    | _        |
| 9      | VEAC                   | Dataset tree | see note    | _        |
| 10     | VAEC                   | Dataset tree | see note    | _        |
| 11     | CEAV                   | Dataset tree | see note    | _        |
| 12     | String Literal Counter | Dataset tree | `u8`        | `u64`    | 
| 13     | String Literal to ID   | Dataset tree | `u8 string` | `u64`    |
| 14     | ID to String Literal   | Dataset tree | `u8 u64`    | `string` |

Values also have prefixes to say what kind of Value they are.

| Prefix | Type    |
| ------ | ------- |
| 0      | Entity  |
| 1      | String  |
| 2      | Integer |
| 3      | Float   |

NOTE:

Inside of a Dataset's tree, Statements are stored in a way that is inspired by the hexastore (I guess in Ligature's case it's a heptastore?) architecture.
This involves storing many permutations of the Statement.
Entities are referneced by their IDs.
Attributes are referenced by their IDs.
Values are referenced by the above prefix and their value (if a long or float) or ID (if a String or Entity).
Contexts are referenced by their IDs (they are just Entities).
So for example below is how EAVC is stored.

| Prefix | Entity | Attribute | Value w/ Prefix | Context |
| ------ | ------ | --------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `u8 `  | `u64`  | `u64`     | `u8 u64`        | `u64`   |

A similar pattern is used for the other six entries.
